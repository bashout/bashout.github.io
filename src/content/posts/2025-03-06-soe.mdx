I would claim that 2024 can be described as the year of getting back on track. In it, I spent the latter half of the year sober, minimised gaming time,
focused on my health and on work; In doing so, I feel I reached the closest state to the 'zone' I may ever reach.

## BJJ

In March 2024, I made a concerted effort to commit to training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu once again. Historically being on and off with hobbies I was skeptical, but really hopeful that this may be the time for it to stick and having found a local, supportive gym to
restart that journey on, I have been spending between 2-5 days per week training consistently. I'd even argue it's showing results.

<br />
My physique, which historically has been left lacking, has begun to fill out as
I've learned to improve what was likely a very meagre diet lol. I've began the
process of understanding my conflict with migraines as the increased exertion
definitely coincided with a massive spike in ocurrences (8 since April 2024!).
However successes are pending on this front...

<br />
I've even dipped my toe in recreational competition, having took part in three
different competitions throughout the year! My record stands at 4-3 in the gi,
with one silver and two bronze medals. The real positive of each competition
being the takeaways... either the one after or the more metaphorical sort.

<br />
I'd argue, BJJ can be thanked for my improved workplace motivation, sleep
pattern, eating habits and general physical activity and is honestly not an
activity I can see myself ever dropping, so onwards and upwards. Osu!

## Finances

I'm rather financially motivated. Most around me are capable of rapidly acknowledging how willing I am to talk about my own finances, thus I don't mind posting a general overview of the year here.

<br />
Starting the year being most assuredly house poor, a significant goal of mine
was to rapidly build up more than what was simply an emergency fund. Thankfully
due to stable work progress ([See here](#work)), some savvy decisions and a
general thrifty mindset, I achieved my year goal of maxxing the government
allowed stocks and shares ISA limit.

<br />
Being a firm believer in putting money to work, I've primarily focused my
investment strategy on long term investing in an all world tracker fund. Though
I'll likely provide a greater breakdown of my portfolio in future.

## Work

Starting the year in a verifiable state of flux with work, struggling to find a place in the project I had at the time, the Home Office, alongside other government apartments adopted the PFA system for pay awards in October, lighting a fire under me. Said fire, allowed me to finally make that step up and become a pivotal worker once again. With some necessary guidance from a friendly lead who carved out some key pieces of work for myself and some newfound routine provided by my improved lifestyle, I secured myself a solid payraise in January 2025 through the PFA being considered a 'guru' for a mid-level developer.

<br />
Following on from that, I took the momentum provided to push for the senior role
which I had already been recommended for on a few occasions. Following a labored
application process and an interview where I didn't feel I conveyed myself and
my skills sucessfully, the resultant outcome was in fact highly positive and as
of the 25th of February I have once again secured the title of Senior Software
Developer, this time specialising in Java.

## What's next?

Moving into the end of the 2024 fiscal year and off the back of a broadly successful year, some might decide to rest on their laurels. I however still have numerous goals in all areas. All of which I believe can be achieved through the learnings I've had throughout this year.

<br />
So for 2025, maintaining the following principles:

- 7-8 hours of sleep a night
- Working only during the social hours
- Moderate or intense exercise 4 days per
  week

<br />
Alongise taking adequate rest, inspired by Jon Gjengset and outlined in his
blog, I hope to continue my newfound routine and make next year an even greater
success!
