## Middlemanagement failings
* Historic complaints of an overburdence of middle management
* A lack of empowerment of said middlemanagement
  * Through unwillingness or nonexistence pipelines to improve process

## Commonality of work and process lack of structure
* Same ideas time and time again, good people repeating the same issues
  * Do people think they're reinventing the wheel?
  * Do the wheels turn too slowly?
